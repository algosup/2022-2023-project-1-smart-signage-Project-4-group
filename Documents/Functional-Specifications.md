## 1. Introduction 

All stores are equipped with signs so that everyone can know their name. However, the sign sector has not known any innovation for several decades already. <br>
That's why SignAll wants to change that! Through the innovations they wish to bring, the company wishes to develop and revolutionize this field.

They contacted us to created this intelligent sign they want to commercialize. They want their client to be able to control their signages wherever and whenever they want.

## 2. Glossary:

- LED: a light-emitting diode (a semiconductor diode which glows when a voltage is applied)
- dim: make or become less bright or distinct
- hardware: the machines, wiring, and other physical components of a computer or other electronic system
- GO: programming language

## 3. Stakeholders:

During this project for SignAll, there are 2 different kind of stakeholders.

### 3.1. The sponsor:

First of all, there is the client, at the beginning of the project it will be represented by Franck JEANNIN, but after it, it will be directly the sponsor : SignAll <br>

Specialized in signs and signage for more than 50 years for international brands, the SignAll's field of action covers all the media that bring the company image to life: signs, flags, illuminated lettering, billboards, badges, boxes, banners, totems, interior signage, adhesives...

The SignAll team who works on this project is composed of:
- Bertrand MEURIOT: CEO of SignAll 
- Cédric DUMEZ: IT manager at SignAll
- Nicolas RICHARD: Industrial manager at SignAll 

### 3.2. The engineering team:

The second stakeholders type is the engineering team who will directly work on the development and the conception of the project. This team his made of 5 people : <br>
* Robin DEBRY as the project manager
* Quentin CLEMENT as the program manager
* Laurent BOUQUIN as the technical leader
* Florent HUREAUX as the software engineer
* Alexis LASSELIN as the quality insurance

## 4. Monitoring of the signage:

The monitoring of the signage is the main point of the development of this project. <br>

The user will use an application (need to check with SignAll if there is already an existing one) connected to the signage via antennas. He should be able to see if the signage is on, if it is off. The customer will add to the application as many signages as he wants and the state (on/off) of the sign will be writen directly under the name of the signage. If a LED is broken, it will also be written under the state of the signage. When he clicks on the signage he wants, there will have a dedicate page for this sign. On it there will have the name, the state of the sign, if something isn't working, the actual brightness and temperature of the signage, since when it is on/off.

This function will really be an informative one, it has the role of informing the user of the status of the signage in real time.

## 5. Remote control of the signage:

The remote control of the signage is the second parameter to consider during this project. <br>

The user will be able to manage the signage via an application. He should be able to switch the signage on or off and dim manually as he would do for a smartphone.

This will be the interactive feature between the signage and the user.

## 6. Consumption reduction and compliance with environmental laws:

As we all now, nowadays global warming is in everyone's mind and a large number of constraints are imposed on companies to avoid the various pollutions. <br>
In the case of signages it is light pollution and electricity consumption that are targeted by the different laws.

To help SignAll in this field, we will add an intelligent feature to replace the human action. The signage will automatically turn on and off depending on the hour choose by the user (probably in function of environmental laws). <br>
There will also be a feature to automatically adapt the brightness of the signage depending on the ambient brightness

## 7. Personas:

### 7.1 Store manager:

Phillipe CHATRIER is the manager of AXA Vierzon since 2012. He is 47 years old married with 2 children who are now adults. He loves sport and road trips with his wife during his free time. He lives in Bourges, he takes the train every morning and evening. <br>
His job is to manage the whole store so dealing with his signage is not his priority and can sometimes be a waste of time. <br>
He has to send a technician to make an annual check to be sure the signage is working. With Appsolu, he will have the role "Gérant du magasin" and he would be able to check if the signage is on or off and to know if some LEDs are broken so he can ask a technician from SignAll to come to change it. He will receive a notification if the signage is anormaly off. 
On his days off, he can turn the panel on/off from home whenever he wants or schedule a time to turn the panel on/off automatically. He will be able to dim the LED's by himself if he thinks it is necessary. <br>
With these improvements, he will save money because the frequency of interventions will be lower, as will the electricity consumption, and it will save time by focusing on things other than signage.

## 7.2 Technician:

Suzanne LENGLEN is a technician at SignAll since 2019. She is 32 years old, married and has 2 children, and lives in Méreau with them. She loves food and spending time with her friends. <br>
Her job is to install and repair the signages in all the shops of the region. She also has to make control of the signages one time a year in every shops to know if it needs a reparation. <br>
Suzanne will have the role "Technicien", she will be able to check at every moment the state of the signages (on/off, if it's anormaly off). She has to go to AXA Vierzon every december to verify if everything is ok. With Appsolu, she will be able to avoid this annual intervention and she will only intervene if she sees that the signage has a problem and it needs to be repaired. If she needs to use the remote control features to make tests she will ask via the application the authorization to Phillipe Chatrier. <br> 
It will reduce the frequency of her visits to the shop and will be able to replace the time lost with the signage to do other tasks.

## 7.3 CEO of SignAll:

Bertrand MEURIOT is the CEO of SignAll. He is 41 years old, married and has 3 children. His hobbies are running and dogs.
<br>
His job is to manage the company and especially the commercial part. He has 80 employees under his responsability. He wants to make the company grown and he is constantly trying to innovate in the signage field, for him, Appsolu is the first innovation to improve his signs. <br>
He wants a technology that will possesse these features: monitoring of the signage, a remote control and a consumption reduction of the signages. He wants something that is addable to old signages and new ones. He wants something not too big, not laggy and something that will not be too sensitive to weather constraints. Signages are a product with a long life expectancy so he wants a product that will last a long time.

### 7.4 Roles on the application:

In the future, different roles will be created on the application to help everyone (depending on what they have to do on the sign) to help manage the signs in the best way. 

## 8. The technology:

The hardware that has been entrusted to us is a *LoRa-E5 dev board* that uses the LoRaWAN protocol.
LoRaWAN protocol is a radio communication protocol, used in low energy networks. It will be use to transmit informations and orders between the user and the STM32. <br>
The STM32 will be the element that will execute the orders of the user.
There will be other elements like ST-Link, to connect the LoRa to the STM32 and different sensors to collect information on the signage and warn the user of the status of the signage and anticipate possible failures. 
We will use GO to program the STM32.

## 9. Conclusion:

This project will help SignAll and all its client to improve their way of working. It will helps them saving time and limiting the energy losses to protect the planet and their wallets.

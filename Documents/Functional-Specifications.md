## 1. Introduction

This project has been ordered by SignAll, a signage company in Vierzon. <br>
They want to make their signage evolve to be able to check at the status of the panels, and control it remotely to make it easier, cheaper and more respectfull of the environment.

## 2. Definition of terms:

- dim: brightness, light intensity
- 

## 3. Stakeholders:

During this project for SignAll, there are 2 different kind of stakeholders.

### 3.1. The sponsor:

First of all, there is the client, at the beginning of the project it will be represented by Franck JEANNIN, but after it, it will be directly the sponsor : SignAll <br>

Specialized in signs and signage for more than 50 years for international brands, the SignAll's field of action covers all the media that bring the company image to life: signs, flags, illuminated lettering, billboards, badges, boxes, banners, totems, interior signage, adhesives...

### 3.2. The engineering team:

The second stakeholders type is the engineering team who will directly work on the development and the conception of the project. This team his made of 5 people : <br>
* Robin DEBRY as the project manager
* Quentin CLEMENT as the program manager
* Laurent BOUQUIN as the technical leader
* Florent HUREAUX as the software engineer
* Alexis LASSELIN as the quality insurance


## 4. The hardware:


## 5. Monitoring of the signage

The monitoring of the signage is the main point of the development of this project. <br>

The user will use an application connected to the signage via antennas. He should be able to see if the signage is on, if it is off, since when it is on/off, the dim of the panel, the heat of the signage to prevent from over-heating, and if it is off abnormally warn the user there could be a breakdown.

This function will really be an informative one, it has the role of informing the user of the status of the signage in real time.



At the end of the project, the user needs to be able to do 3 things: <br>
* The monitoring of the signage is probably the main point of this project. The user of the application needs to know how the signage is going on: if it is on/off, since when it is on/off, the heat of the signage to prevent over-heating, be warned in case of breakdown...
* The remote control of the sign is the second parameter to consider in this project. The user has to be able to control the signage remotely, switching it on/off, change manually the dim of the signage.
* The last option is related to the environmental laws and consumption reduction, the signage will automatically switch on/off at a defined hour and the intensity will change depending on the ambient lightning.

## <p style="text-decoration: underline">1. Stakeholders:</p>

During this project for SignAll, there are 2 different kind of stakeholders. <br>

### <p style="text-decoration: underline">1.1 The sponsor:</p>

First of all, there is the client, at the beginning of the project it will be represented by Franck JEANNIN, but after it, it will be directly the sponsor : SignAll <br>

Specialized in signs and signage for more than 50 years for international brands, the SignAll's field of action covers all the media that bring the company image to life: signs, flags, illuminated lettering, billboards, badges, boxes, banners, totems, interior signage, adhesives...

### <p style="text-decoration: underline">1.2 The engineering team:</p>

The second stakeholders type is the engineering team who will directly work on the development and the conception of the project. This team his made of 5 people : <br>
* Robin DEBRY as the project manager
* Quentin CLEMENT as the program manager
* Laurent BOUQUIN as the technical leader
* Florent HUREAUX as the software engineer
* Alexis LASSELIN as the quality insurance

## <p style="text-decoration: underline">2. Goal of the project:</p>

At the end of the project, the user needs to be able to do 3 things: <br>
* The monitoring of the signage is probably the main point of this project. The user of the application needs to know how the signage is going on: if it is on/off, since when it is on/off, the heat of the signage to prevent over-heating, be warned in case of breakdown...
* The remote control of the sign is the second parameter to consider in this project. The user has to be able to control the signage remotely, switching it on/off 
* The last option is related to the environmental laws and consumption reduction, the signage will automatically switch on/off at a defined hour and the intensity will change depending on the ambient lightning.

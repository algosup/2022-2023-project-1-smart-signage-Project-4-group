## **I. Introduction**

This project has been ordered by SignAll, a signage company in Vierzon. <br>

When starting a project, one must imagine all possible eventualities in order to reduce the loss of time caused by them. The risks we thought about are:
| **Risk**                                                                      | **Mitigation**                                        |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| The project schedule is too tight; itâ€™s hard to complete this project on time | Set Test Priority for each of the test activity.      |
| A team member is missing                                                      | Distribute his tasks to the rest of the team members. |
